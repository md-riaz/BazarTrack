implementing **full history tracing** and using **professional concepts** like DDD (Domain-Driven Design), modular architecture, and data integrity practices will make this project robust and production-ready. Here's an enhanced and detailed **Flutter project plan** tailored to your use case:

---

## ✅ **Project Name**

**BazarTrack** – Smart Purchase and Money Management System

---

## 🧱 Architectural Overview

### 📐 **Tech Stack**

* **Frontend:** Flutter with modular & layered architecture
* **Backend (optional):** Supabase, Firebase, or Pocketbase
* **State Management:** Riverpod (recommended for scalability)
* **Database:** SQLite (offline-first) or backend-syncable NoSQL
* **Authentication:** Email/password (with roles)
* **History Audit:** Event sourcing + change log table

---

## 🧩 **Key Modules and Features**

### 1. 👥 **User & Role System**

* Roles: `Owner`, `Assistant`
* Each user has:

  * ID, Name, Role
  * Wallet (Advance balance), Transaction log

### 2. 📦 **Order Management**

* Order = a purchase task with metadata
* Fields:

  * `OrderID`, `CreatedBy`, `AssignedTo`, `Status`, `CreatedAt`, `CompletedAt`
  * **Status:** `Draft`, `Assigned`, `In Progress`, `Completed`
* Assistants can self-assign, or owner can assign
* Orders contain many **Order Items**

### 3. 🧾 **Order Items**

* Product name, Quantity, Unit (`kg`, `litre`, `pcs`, etc.)
* Estimated Cost (optional), Actual Purchase Cost
* Status per item: `Pending`, `Purchased`, `Unavailable`
* Editable individually
* Optionally add product catalog support

### 4. 💰 **Advance Payments**

* Owner gives assistants advance payments:

  * `Amount`, `Date`, `GivenBy`, `ReceivedBy`
* Each item purchased reduces assistant balance
* Show real-time assistant wallet

### 5. 📜 **Full History and Change Tracking (Audit Trail)**

**Professional Concepts:**

* **Event Logging**:

  * Every meaningful action creates a `HistoryLog` entry
  * Examples: `Order Created`, `Item Updated`, `Advance Given`, `Purchase Recorded`
* **Entity Versioning**:

  * Store previous states of critical entities (Order, Items, Wallet)
  * Allow rollback or inspection
* **Who-did-what-when**

**Model: `HistoryLog`**

```dart
class HistoryLog {
  final String id;
  final String entityType; // e.g., "Order", "OrderItem", "Advance"
  final String entityId;
  final String action; // "created", "updated", "assigned", "purchased"
  final String changedByUserId;
  final DateTime timestamp;
  final Map<String, dynamic> dataSnapshot; // JSON of previous/new state
}
```

└── main.dart
```

## 📊 **UX/UI Concepts**

### Owner Dashboard

* Stats: Total Orders, Assigned, In Progress, Completed
* Assistant Wallet Summary
* Advance History
* Order Activity Timeline

### Assistant Dashboard

* Assigned Orders
* Wallet Balance
* Purchase Entry Screens

### Order Detail View

* List of items with status and editable fields
* Timeline (auto-generated from `HistoryLog`)
* Action Log

---

## 🔁 **Business Workflow Example**

1. Owner creates order: `"Buy items for June 5"`
2. Adds items: `Rice - 10kg`, `Milk - 2L`, `Eggs - 30pcs`
3. Owner gives `Rs. 3000` advance to Assistant A
4. Assistant A self-assigns or gets assigned
5. Assistant updates:

   * Rice: Rs. 800
   * Milk: Rs. 140
   * Eggs: Rs. 240
6. System deducts total Rs. 1,180 from wallet
7. All actions logged in `HistoryLog`
8. Owner views timeline of who did what and when
